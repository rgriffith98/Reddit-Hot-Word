# Reddit-Crawler-Summarizer
Crawls through the front page of Reddit and counts the number of occurrences of words in titles.
I use this to record "hot words" used on reddit on a given day.
NOTE: you may have to run the program multiple times, because reddit is finnickey with web crawlers.

Enjoy!

P.S. as always, if you have any questions, you can find my email on my github profile.
